# **ðŸ§¼ Project Overview**

**NYC Airbnb Data Cleaning Pipeline** is a data engineering project that processes raw Airbnb listing data from New York City and transforms it into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format.

**The goal** of this project is to simulate a real-world ETL pipeline using Python and pandas. It reads a raw CSV file, performs a series of cleaning and transformation steps â€” including handling missing values, fixing data types, removing duplicates, normalizing column names, and filtering invalid entries â€” and then outputs a cleaned CSV for use in analytics, visualization, or machine learning workflows.

This project demonstrates key data engineering skills such as:

Working with messy real-world data

Building modular, reusable pipeline code

Designing reproducible data processing workflows

Preparing datasets for downstream analysis

The cleaned data can be used to power dashboards, generate business insights, or serve as the input for predictive models (e.g., estimating nightly prices, predicting availability, etc.).
